# Weather App üå§Ô∏è

This Weather App is a Node.js and Express-based web application that allows users to enter their location (ZIP code and country code) to fetch and display real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app visually represents weather conditions through effects like rain, sun, clouds, and nighttime views, making the experience more interactive and engaging.

## Features

- **Location-based Weather**: Users can input their ZIP code and country code to get specific weather details for their area.
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve and display current temperature, humidity, visibility, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- **Visual Weather Effects**: Adds dynamic effects like rain, sunshine, clouds, or nighttime depending on the weather conditions.
- **Responsive and Interactive Design**: Designed to be visually appealing with smooth transitions and intuitive UI elements.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**:
  - `index.html`: Main HTML file for the frontend structure.
  - `style.css`: Contains styling for forms, backgrounds, and weather effects (e.g., rain, sun, clouds, and night themes).
  - `handler.js`: Handles frontend interactions, submits form data, and applies visual effects based on the weather data.

- **Backend**:
  - `server.js`: Node.js Express server that handles the `/submitWeather` route, fetches location and weather data from OpenWeatherMap, and returns the results.
  - `handler.js`: Contains JavaScript functions to create weather effects and display real-time weather information based on user input.
